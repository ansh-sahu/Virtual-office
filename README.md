# Virtual-Office
<i>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
    Virtual office is a cloud-based unified communications (UC) offering, and it competes with similar products such as Slack, Cisco Webex and Google classroom and MS Team. As a business communications app, Virtual office enables local and remote workers to collaborate on content in real time and near-real time across different devices, including laptops and mobile devices. Virtual office integrates with other business applications, including Exchange, PowerPoint and SharePoint.
    <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Virtual office is a persistent chat-based collaboration platform complete with document sharing, online meetings, and many more extremely useful features for business communications. Having an excellent team space is key to being able to make creative decisions and communicate with one another. Shared workspace software makes this much easier to achieve, especially if a particular team is based in a very large company, has many remote employees, or is made up of a significant amount of team members. 
    <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
Virtual office is usually deployed across entire organizations and not just within certain company departments. In some cases, Teams could replace email for internal company communication among employees.
